This Personal Blog enables users to enter a username, content title and content body, which when submitted is displayed alongside all other content submitted. This content is saved in the browsers local storage and rendered in a list format. The application is able to be toggled from light to dark mode and notifys a user when the submission form has blank entries. If the user opens the application field within inspect in their browser, they are presented with an array of submission data including the title, a username and the content. The Personal Blog also has links to my own profile and github within the footer.

Throughout this project I learned to utilise a range of Javascript functions to make the application interactive and functional. I was able to practice manuipulating the DOM and both storing and retrieving data from the browser's local storage. I was also able to learn about dark and light mode switching and how to set this up within an application. This project was a great opportunity to tie together HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an interactive web application.
